**MASTERING HTML AND CSS COURSE** <br/> <br/>
 

**Requirements**
The minimum requirement to follow this challenge <br/>
**1.** Computer <br/>
**2.** Internet <br/>
**3.** Consistency <br/>



**Setting Development Environment** <br/>
**Browser** <br/>
There are many browsers out there but most developers prefer to use Google Chrome or FireFox. I usually use Google chrome for development and I recommend it too. Download https://www.google.com/chrome/ Google Chrome if you do not have one.

The browser render your HTML code to a human read website.


**Code Editor** <br/>

As web developer, you should write code using a text or code editor. Therefore, to write HTML code, CSS, JS, React etc. You need to have a code edit.

I will use Visual studio code and I will use it in this challenge too. I strongly suggest to use Visual Studio Code because it has lots of productivity extensions that makes super productive. Now, let's download https://code.visualstudio.com/Download visual studio code. <br/>


**Web Development**
Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that are accessible via a web browser. The field encompasses various roles, which includes: <br/>

**.** Frontend development <br/>
**.** Backend development <br/>

**Front-end development:**  Focuses on the user interface, ensuring a good user experience and visual appeal through design, layout, and interactive elements. <br/>
Therefore, anything we see on any website when we surf on the internet is part of the front end and it includes the colors, fonts, buttons, images, videos, audios and any other content on the website. The technologies that uses to build front end parts of a website are called front end technologies. The core technologies to build a front end are:
1. HTML <br/>
2. CSS <br/>
3. JavaScript <br/>

There are hundreds of JavaScript that allows building a dynamic web applications. Currently, the three most popular JavaScript libraries are:

**.** React <br/>
**.** Vue <br/>
**.** Angular <br/>
Do not learn learn JavaScript before, HTML and CSS. Do not learn JavaScript libraries before you learn JavaScript. This the right sequence of learning:HTML > CSS > JavaScript > React or Vue or Angular.

**Back-end development:**  Deals with the server, database, and application logic that powers the website or application. Back-end development (the server, database, and application logic), often requiring a blend of creative problem-solving and technical skills to deliver smooth and efficient user experiences. <br/>
The backend interacts with frontend and the database using a backend programming language that could be (Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc). Look at the following figure to understand the interaction between client. A client send a HTTP request to the backend and the backend return a HTTP response to the client computer(The response could be an HTML page, txt, image, or any other form of data). HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol that allow transmitting data between a client and a sever. It is designed for communication between web browsers(client) and web servers.  <br/>

**EVERY LESSONS YOU WILL FIND ON THIS "HTML" AND "CSS" COURSE (below)** <br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Introduction To HTML** <br/>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was at CERN, to help scientists share information online. Its early versions established core features like headings, paragraphs, and hyperlinks. After several versions and the creation of XHTML to align with XML, the web standard became fragmented. To address this, the W3C and WHATWG collaborated to develop HTML5, which is now the widely adopted and evolving standard for building websites and web applications. <br/>

The word HTML is an acronym. That is stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup languages to develop websites. HTML is the build block of the web that allows building layouts of page using HTML elements. HTML is not not a programming language instead it is a markup language.

HTML code will be rendered by a browser and it give a human readable output. Look at the figure bellow to understand better how the HTML code convert to a website using a browser.  <br/> <br/>



**All "HTML" TAGS** (Note: majority Used on this Course) <br/>

HTML has a comprehensive set of tags used to structure content on a web page. The full list is extensive, but tags are generally grouped by their function into categories like document structure, text formatting, forms, and media. <br/>

**Here Are The List Of Common And Noteworthy HTML Tags, Organized by Category:** <br/>
✔️  **Document structure** <br/> 
These tags provide the basic framework for any HTML document, They include: <br/>

➡️ **The "textarea" tag**: for multi-line text. <br/>
➡️ **The "button" tag**: is used to create clickable buttons on a webpage. <br/>
➡️ **The "select", "option" tag**: Drop-down lists are made with this. <br/>
➡️ **The "label" tag**: defines a label for input elements.. <br/>
➡️ **The "fieldset" tag**: Related form elements can be grouped. <br/>
➡️ **The "legend" tag**: given a caption with this. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Introduction To CSS** <br/>
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, working alongside HTML and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web pages. <br/>  <br/>

**All "CSS" elements** (Note: majority Used on this Course) <br/>

**Here Are The List Of Common And Noteworthy CSS Tree, Organized by Category:** <br/>
➡️ **Selectors**  <br/>
1. Element Selector **""**: Selects all instances of an element, such as p for all paragraphs. The CSS element selector selects all elements with the specified element name.The element selector uses the HTML tag name itself as the selector, like, h2 {color: blue;
  text-align: center;} <br/>
2. Class Selector **".class"**: Selects all elements with a specific class attribute, like, .intro { }  <br/>
3. ID Selector **"#id"**: Selects a single element with a unique ID attribute, like, #firstname { } <br/>  
4. Universal Selector **"*"**: Selects all element  <br/> 
5. Attribute Selector **"[attribute|="value"]"**: An attribute selector in CSS is a type of selector that targets HTML elements based on the presence or value of a specific attribute, like, [attribute="value"] { /* Styles applied to elements where 'attribute' equals 'value' */ } <br/>
6. Pseudocode-Class Selector ****: A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, for example, they are the first element of their type  <br/>
7. Pseudo-element Selector **"::"**: A CSS pseudo-element selector applies styles to specific, abstract parts of an element that are not directly represented by distinct HTML elements in the document tree, like , selector::pseudo-element-name { }
 <br/>
 
 ➡️ **Box Model**  <br/>
 Components of the CSS Box Model <br/>
 1. Content : The innermost part where the actual data, such as text and images, appears. Its size is set using the width and height properties. <br/>
 2. Padding : The transparent space surrounding the content, clearing an area around it. The padding property controls its size. <br/>
 3. Border : A line that wraps around the padding and content, which can be styled and sized with the border property. <br/>
 4. Margin : The outermost transparent space that creates separation between the box and other elements on the page. The margin property controls its size. <br/> <br/>

  ➡️ **Display Property**  <br/>
Key Values and Their Behavior: <br/>
 1. block:  <br/>
    1i. Elements with display: block always start on a new line.  <br/>
    1ii. They take up the full available width of their parent container. <br/>
    1iii. Examples include "div", "p", "h1" to "h6" tags. <br/>
    1iv. Margins, padding, and height can be applied to all four sides. <br/>
 2. inline:  <br/>
    2i. Elements with display: inline do not start on a new line. <br/>
    211. They only take up the width necessary for their content. <br/>
    2iii. Examples include "span", "a", "strong" tag. <br/>
    2iv. Top and bottom margins and height cannot be directly applied; padding can be applied but may overlap with adjacent elements. <br/>
 3. inline-block:  <br/>
    3i. This value combines characteristics of both inline and block. <br/>
    3ii. Elements with display: inline-block do not start on a new line (like inline). <br/>
    3iii. They allow the application of top/bottom margins, padding, and height (like block). <br/>
 4. none: <br/>
     4i.  Setting display: none completely removes the element from the document flow. <br/>
     4ii. The element becomes invisible, and it does not occupy any space on the page. <br/>
 5. flex: <br/>
     5i.  Transforms an element into a flex container, enabling the use of Flexbox properties for powerful and flexible layout management of its children. <br/>
     5ii. Transforms an element into a grid container, enabling the use of CSS Grid properties for two-dimensional, grid-based layout. <br/> <br/>

➡️ **Positioning**  <br/>
There are five main values for the position property: <br/>
1.)  static: This is the default value for all HTML elements. Static-positioned elements are rendered in the normal document flow and are not affected by top, right, bottom, or left properties. <br/>

2.)  relative: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. Applying top, right, bottom, or left will shift the element from its original location, but it still occupies its space in the normal flow, meaning other elements will not fill the gap it leaves behind. <br/>

3.)  absolute: An element with position: absolute; is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its nearest non-static positioned ancestor. If no such ancestor exists, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the <html> element or the viewport). Absolute positioning allows for precise placement using top, right, bottom, and left. <br/>

 4.)  fixed: An element with position: fixed; is also removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to the viewport. This means it stays in the same position on the screen even when the user scrolls the page. <br/>

 5.)  sticky: An element with position: sticky; behaves like position: relative; within its normal flow until a specified scroll threshold is met. Once that threshold is reached, it then behaves like position: fixed;, sticking to a particular position within the viewport as the user continues to scroll. <br/> <br/>

  ➡️ **FlexBox**   <br/>
 Key 2 Concepts of Flexbox:  <br/>
 1. Flex Container: The parent element that holds the flex items. To enable Flexbox, the display property of this element is set to flex or inline-flex. <br/>
 2. Flex Items: The direct children of the flex container. These items will be arranged and aligned according to the Flexbox properties applied to the container and themselves. <br/>
 
**For the "Flex Container properties"**:
1i. flex-direction: Defines the direction of the main axis (e.g., row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse). <br/>

1ii. justify-content: Aligns flex items along the main axis (e.g., flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly). <br/>

1iii. align-items: Aligns flex items along the cross axis (e.g., flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch). <br/>

1iv.  flex-wrap: Controls whether flex items wrap onto multiple lines (e.g., nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse). <br/>

1v. align-content: Aligns multiple lines of flex items along the cross axis when flex-wrap is set to wrap or wrap-reverse (e.g., flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch). <br/>

1vi.  flex-flow: A shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap. <br/>

1vii. display: flex <br/>

**For the "Flex Items Properties"**:
2i. flex-grow: Defines the ability of a flex item to grow if necessary. <br/>

2ii. flex-shrink: Defines the ability of a flex item to shrink if necessary. <br/>

2iii. flex-basis: Defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. <br/>

2iv.  flex: A shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. <br/>

2v. order: Controls the visual order of flex items within the container. <br/>

2vi. align-self: Overrides the align-items property for individual flex items.  <br/> <br/>


➡️ **Grid**  <br/>
Key grid "Container / item Properties":  <br/>

**For the "grid container Properties"**:
1. display: grid  or display: inline-grid: Turns an element into a grid container, making its direct children into grid items. <br/>

2. grid-template-columns: Define the number and size of columns in the grid.  Creates a grid with three equally wide columns that size to their content.  <br/>

3. grid-template-rows: Define the number and size of rows in the grid. Creates a grid with a first row 100px tall and a second row 200px tall.  <br/>

4. grid-auto-columns: specifies the size of an implicitly-created grid column track or pattern of tracks. means it defines the size of columns that are not explicitly defined by grid-template-columns. <br/>

5. grid-auto-rows: specifies the size of an implicitly-created grid row track or pattern of tracks. <br/>

6. gap (or grid-gap): A shorthand for grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap, setting the space between grid rows and columns.  <br/>

7. grid-template-areas: Creates a grid layout based on named areas, which are defined using grid-area on the grid items.  <br/>

8. align-content: This property aligns the grid's rows along the column (block) axis. <br/>

9. align-items: The align-items property sets the align-self property for all of the child grid items.  <br/>

10. grid-auto-flow: The grid-auto-flow CSS property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works, specifying exactly how auto-placed items get flowed into the grid. <br/>

**For the "grid item Properties"**: <br/>
1. grid-column: A shorthand property for grid-column-start and grid-column-end.  <br/>

2. grid-column-start: Specifies the starting grid line for a grid item along the column axis. <br/>

3. grid-column-end: Specifies the ending grid line for a grid item along the column axis. <br/>

4. grid-row: A shorthand property for grid-row-start and grid-row-end.  <br/>

5. grid-row-start: Specifies the starting grid line for a grid item along the row axis. <br/>

6. grid-row-end: Specifies the ending grid line for a grid item along the row axis. <br/>

7. align-self: is used to align individual grid items within their respective grid areas along the block (vertical) axis. It overrides the align-items property set on the grid container for that specific it. <br/>

8. justify-content: The justify-content property is used to align the grid items when they do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).  <br/>

9. grid-area: A shorthand property that defines a grid item's size and location by specifying its grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end. <br/>

10. justify-self: Aligns the content of a grid item along the row (inline) axis within its grid area. Values include start, end, center, and stretch.  <br/>

11. place-self: A shorthand property for align-self and justify-self.  <br/> <br/>


➡️ **Visual Effects**  <br/>
CSS offers various properties and functions for applying visual effects to elements on a webpage. These effects can enhance the aesthetic appeal and interactivity of a website without requiring external image editing software, they include: <br/>

⚡️**Transitions**:  <br/>
Key CSS "Transition" Properties: <br/>
      i.) transition-property: Specifies which CSS property or properties to transition. all can be used to transition all applicable properties. <br/>
      ii.) transition-duration: Sets the length of time the transition takes to complete (e.g., 2s, 500ms). <br/>
      iii.) transition-timing-function: Defines the speed curve of the transition, controlling how the animation progresses (e.g., ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, cubic-bezier()). <br/>
      iv.) transition-delay: Specifies a delay before the transition begins after the trigger is activated. <br/>
      
⚡️**Animations**:  <br/>

      ii.) animation-duration: Sets the length of time an animation takes to complete one cycle. <br/>
      iii.) animation-timing-function: Defines the speed curve of the animation (e.g., linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic-bezier(), steps()). <br/>
      iv.) animation-delay: Specifies a delay before the animation starts. <br/>
      v.) animation-iteration-count: Determines how many times an animation should play (e.g., 1, infinite). <br/>
      vi.) animation-direction: Controls whether the animation should play forwards, backwards, or alternate directions on each cycle. <br/>
      vii.) animation-fill-mode: Specifies what styles are applied to the element before and after the animation runs. <br/>
      viii.) animation-play-state: Allows pausing or resuming an animation. <br/>
      
⚡️**Css Transforms**:  <br/>
Key CSS "Transforms" Properties: <br/>
     i.) translate(x, y): Moves an element along the X and Y axes. <br/>
     ii.) rotate(angle): Rotates an element around its origin. <br/>
     iii.) scale(x, y): Resizes an element along the X and Y axes. <br/>
     iv.) skew(x-angle, y-angle): Skews an element along the X and Y axes. <br/>
     v.) matrix(): Combines all 2D transform functions into a single matrix. <br/>

⚡️**Css Filter Effect**:  <br/>
Key CSS "Filter Effect" Properties: <br/>
     i.) blur(): Applies a Gaussian blur to the element. <br/>
     ii.) brightness(): Adjusts the brightness of the element. <br/>
     iii.) contrast(): Modifies the contrast of the element. <br/>

     xi.)  opacity(): Adjusts the transparency of the element (similar to the opacity property). <br/> <br/>


  ➡️ **Responsive Design**  <br/>
    Responsive web design in CSS relies on several key properties and techniques to ensure a website adapts and displays optimally across various devices and screen sizes. <br/>
    Core  Responsive Design Properties: <br/>
1. **Media Queries**: <br/>
   1i.) Media queries are a fundamental CSS feature that allows the application of different styles based on device characteristics like screen width, height, orientation, and resolution. <br/>
   1ii.) They enable the creation of "breakpoints," which are specific screen sizes where the layout or styling changes to better suit the device. <br/>
   
   Example: <br/>
    @media (max-width: 768px) { <br/>
       /* Styles for screens up to 768px wide */ <br/>
       .container { <br/>
         flex-direction: column; <br/>
       }  <br/>
     }  <br/>

2. **Viewport Meta Tag**: <br/>
   2i.) The meta name="viewport" tag in HTML is crucial for instructing browsers on mobile devices how to render the page, ensuring it's not scaled down to fit the entire desktop version. <br/>
   
3. **Flexible Images and Media**: <br/>
   3i.) Images and other media should also scale responsively to prevent overflow and maintain a visually appealing layout. <br/>
   3ii.) Setting max-width: 100%; and height: auto; on images ensures they don't exceed their container's width and maintain their aspect ratio. <br/>
   3iii.) The picture element and srcset attribute in HTML, combined with CSS, allow for serving different image sizes based on the device's capabilities. <br/>
   
   Example: <br/>
     img {  <br/>
          max-width: 100%; <br/>
          height: auto;  <br/>
      } <br/>
      
4. **Container Queries (Emerging)**: <br/>
    4i.) Container queries, a newer addition to CSS, allow styling elements based on the size of their parent container rather than the entire viewport. This enables more granular control over component-level responsiveness. <br/>
    
    Example: <br/>
       @container (min-width: 400px) { <br/>
          .card { <br/>
            font-size: 1.2em; <br/>
          }  <br/>
        }  <br/> <br/>


➡️ **Typography**  <br/>
CSS provides numerous properties to control and customize typography on web pages. These properties can be broadly categorized into font-related properties and text-related properties. <br/>

1. **Font Properties** <br/>
CSS font properties control the appearance of text within HTML elements. These properties can be set individually or combined using the font shorthand property. <br/>

   1i.) font-family: Specifies the typeface to be used (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, sans-serif). Multiple font families can be listed as fallbacks. <br/>
   1ii.) font-size: Sets the size of the font (e.g., 16px, 1.2em, large). <br/>
   1iii.)  font-weight: Controls the thickness or boldness of the text (e.g., normal, bold, 400, 700). <br/>
   1iv.) font-style: Determines the slant of the text (e.g., normal, italic, oblique). <br/>
   1v.) font-variant: Specifies whether text should be displayed in small-caps (e.g., normal, small-caps). <br/>
   1vi.) font-stretch: Adjusts the normal width of a font (e.g., normal, condensed, expanded). <br/>
   1vii.) font (Shorthand): A shorthand property to set multiple font properties in a single declaration, following a specific order. <br/>
   
2. **Text Properties**:
   CSS provides a comprehensive set of properties for styling and formatting text within web documents. These properties allow for precise control over the visual appearance of characters, words, lines, and blocks of text. <br/>
   
   2i.) color: Sets the color of the text. <br/>
   2ii.) text-align: Controls the horizontal alignment of text within its containing element (e.g., left, right, center, justify). <br/>
   2iii.)  text-decoration: Adds or removes decorative lines from text (e.g., none, underline, overline, line-through). <br/>
   2iv.) text-transform: Controls the capitalization of text (e.g., none, uppercase, lowercase, capitalize). <br/>
   2v.) text-indent: Indents the first line of a block of text. <br/>
   2vi.) letter-spacing: Adjusts the spacing between individual characters. <br/>
   2vii.) word-spacing: Adjusts the spacing between words. <br/>
   2viii.) line-height: Sets the height of each line of text, affecting the vertical spacing between lines. <br/>
   2ix.) white-space: Controls how whitespace within an element is handled, including text wrapping and line breaks. <br/>
   2x.)  text-shadow: Adds a shadow effect to the text. <br/>
   2xi.) direction: Specifies the text direction within an element (e.g., ltr for left-to-right, rtl for right-to-left). <br/>
   2xii.) vertical-align: Controls the vertical alignment of inline-level elements, including text. <br/>
   
3. **Line Height**: <br/>
The CSS line-height property controls the vertical spacing between lines of text within an element. It defines the height of a line box, which in turn determines the distance between the baselines of consecutive lines of text. <br/>

   3i.) normal: This is the default value. It computes to a "reasonable" value based on the font size of the element, which often varies slightly between browsers. <br/>
   3ii.) number (unitless): This value is a unitless number that is multiplied by the element's font-size to determine the line-height. This is generally the recommended approach as it scales proportionally with the font size. For example, line-height: 1.5; would result in a line height 1.5 times the font size. <br/>
   3iii.)  length: This specifies a fixed line-height using standard CSS length units like px, em, rem, etc. For example, line-height: 24px; <br/>
   3iv.) percentage: This defines the line-height as a percentage of the element's font-size. For example, line-height: 150%; is equivalent to line-height: 1.5; if the font size is the same. <br/>
   3v.) initial: Sets the property to its default value. <br/>
   3vi.) inherit: Inherits the line-height value from the parent element. <br/>
   
4. **Letter Spacing**: <br/>
   
5. **Text Shadow**: <br/>
